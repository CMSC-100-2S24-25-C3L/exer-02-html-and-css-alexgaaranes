__Key Takeaways__: The main key takeaways from this exercise is the usage of flexbox. Before starting the exercise, flexbox is my nemesis when it comes to styling or 
creating the layout of my projects before. After learning about how they actually work, I managed to implement it properly on this exercise which greatly helped me
achieve the glam and style I want for my portfolio page.
